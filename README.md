**Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Google Gemini API (@google/genai)  
**Architecture:** Client-Side SPA with LocalStorage Persistence & Generative AI Integration

---

## 1. Project Overview

**PathFinder AI** is a next-generation career counseling platform designed to replace generic aptitude tests with a "Brutally Honest" AI Accountability Coach. It doesn't just suggest a career; it builds a roadmap, breaks it down into weekly tasks, tracks execution, and verifies learning through AI-generated quizzes.

The platform serves three distinct user ecosystems:
1.  **Students:** Discover careers, generate roadmaps, track weekly progress, and book consultations.
2.  **Consultants:** Manage availability and view assigned sessions.
3.  **Admins:** Oversee user growth, revenue, content (FAQs), and system settings.

## 2. File Structure & Architectural Logic

The project is structured to mimic a scalable production app, separating **View (Pages)**, **Logic (Services)**, and **Data Models (Types)**.

### **Root Directory**
*   **`index.html`**: Application entry point. Loads Tailwind CSS (CDN), Google Fonts (Inter), and React Import Maps.
*   **`index.tsx`**: React Mount point. Initializes the React DOM root.
*   **`types.ts`**: **The Source of Truth**. Defines all TypeScript interfaces (`User`, `RoadmapStep`, `WeeklyPlan`, `ProgressTracker`). This ensures strict type safety across the DB service, AI service, and UI components.
*   **`metadata.json`**: Configuration for browser permission requests (Camera/Microphone) for video sessions.

### **Services (The Logic Layer)**
*   **`services/geminiService.ts` (AI Brain)**
    *   **Role:** Handles all communication with the Google Gemini API.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **`generateQuestions`**: Uses Chain-of-Thought prompting to generate psychometric questions in batches. It reads previous answers to adapt the context of the next batch.
        *   **`analyzeProfile`**: Consumes user answers + budget + location to output a JSON career recommendation with "Reality Check" scores.
        *   **`generateWeeklyPlan`**: Acts as an Accountability Coach. It analyzes the previous week's completion rate and quiz score to determine if the next week should be "Remedial" (repeat topics), "Standard", or "Challenging".
        *   **`generateWeeklyQuiz`**: Dynamically creates a multiple-choice quiz based *specifically* on the tasks the user marked as "Completed".
*   **`services/db.ts` (Persistence Layer)**
    *   **Role:** Acts as a client-side database wrapper using `localStorage`.
    *   **Key Features:**
        *   **CRUD Operations:** Provides methods like `users.create`, `sessions.update`, `progress.save`.
        *   **State Persistence:** Ensures user data, roadmaps, and tracker progress survive page refreshes.
        *   **Seed Data:** Populates the app with demo users/sessions on the first load.

### **Pages (The View Layer)**

#### **`pages/Auth.tsx`**
*   **Function:** Handles User Login and Registration.
*   **Logic:** Includes a specific "Demo Role Selector" to allow developers/judges to instantly log in as Admin, Consultant, or Student for testing purposes.

#### **`pages/UserPortal.tsx` (Core Product)**
*   **Function:** The main student dashboard.
*   **Sub-Modules:**
    1.  **Assessment Engine:** A multi-step wizard (Category -> Details -> AI Questions -> Results).
    2.  **Roadmap Viewer:** Displays the long-term career path generated by AI.
    3.  **Progress Tracker (The "Start Tracking" Flow):**
        *   Converts a static Roadmap into dynamic `WeeklyPlans`.
        *   Features a "Take Skills Quiz" workflow that validates if the user actually learned the material before unlocking the next week.
    4.  **Booking System:** Allows students to book slots based on consultant availability.

#### **`pages/AdminPortal.tsx`**
*   **Function:** System oversight.
*   **Sub-Modules:**
    *   **Analytics Dashboard:** Visual graphs (Recharts) for user growth and revenue.
    *   **Content Manager:** CMS for adding/editing FAQs.
    *   **Session Manager:** CRUD interface to manually schedule or cancel consultations.
    *   **User Manager:** Interface to manually upgrade/downgrade user subscription tiers.

#### **`pages/ConsultantPortal.tsx`**
*   **Function:** Workspace for career experts.
*   **Sub-Modules:**
    *   **Availability Manager:** Calendar interface to set working days/hours (e.g., Mon-Wed, 9 AM - 5 PM).
    *   **Session Lobby:** Lists upcoming sessions with a "Join Room" button that activates only 10 minutes before the meeting.

### **Components (UI Building Blocks)**
*   **`components/Layout.tsx`**: Contains the responsive `Navbar` and `Sidebar`. Handles navigation state.
*   **`components/UI.tsx`**: A library of reusable atomic components (`Button`, `Card`, `Modal`, `Input`) styled with Tailwind CSS to ensure design consistency.

## 3. Core Functionalities & Logic Details

### **A. The AI Accountability Loop**
One of the most complex features is the **Progress Tracker** in `UserPortal.tsx`.
1.  **Initialization:** The user selects a roadmap. `initProgressTracker` calls `geminiService` to generate "Week 1".
2.  **Execution:** User marks tasks as done.
3.  **Verification:** User clicks "Submit Week". The system sends completed tasks to `geminiService.generateWeeklyQuiz`.
4.  **Adaptation:**
    *   **Pass Quiz:** AI generates the next week's plan.
    *   **Fail Quiz:** AI generates a **Remedial Plan** (repeating core topics) instead of moving forward.

### **B. Conflict-Free Booking Algorithm**
Located in `UserPortal.tsx` (or `App.tsx` depending on current refactor), the booking logic ensures integrity:
1.  **Filter:** Finds consultants whose `Availability` matches the selected **Day of Week**.
2.  **Range Check:** Ensures the requested time is within their `startTime` and `endTime`.
3.  **Collision Check:** Scans the `Sessions` table to ensure the consultant isn't already booked at that specific timestamp.

### **C. Brutal Reality Check**
The `analyzeProfile` function in `geminiService` is prompted to be "Brutally Honest".
*   It takes the user's **Budget** (e.g., ₹2 Lakh/year) and **Location Constraint** (e.g., "Local only").
*   It cross-references this with the career choice (e.g., "Pilot").
*   **Output:** It will explicitly flag "Low Feasibility" if the budget doesn't match the career requirements, providing a financial gap analysis.
